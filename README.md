In spring 2020, with time in my hands, I decided to try and give my WordPress Business Webpage a complete overhaul, both in design and content: [smooth-tours.com](https://smooth-tours.com). It was my first contact ever with code.

I got curious, and in summer 2020 I started teaching myself how to code. A month later, I managed to start getting some structure, and I settled mostly on two open source free resources: [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). With sporadic jumps to and tons of help from [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). A huge thanks upfront, they and their communities are amazing!

In fall I went back-end. Ruby is being a different dimension, I'm quite struggling with the abstraction. I notice I'm developing a quite interesting stubborn streak. The web is being again an incredible help. Jesus Castello's [RubyGuides](https://www.rubyguides.com/) jumps to my mind, but there is a ton of others. Again, the folks at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and all the other Vigings around are utterly amazing!
