# [Agathasta's Portfolio](https://agathasta.github.io/)

In spring 2020, with time in my hands, I decided to try and give my WordPress Business Webpage a complete overhaul, both in design and content: [smooth-tours.com](https://smooth-tours.com). It was my first contact ever with code.  
I got curious, and in summer 2020 I started teaching myself. A month later, I had managed to get some structure, and settled mostly on two open source free resources: [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). With sporadic jumps to and tons of help from [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). I was hooked.

- JAVASCRIPT (September 2020)

  - [Calculator](https://agathasta.github.io/projects-javascript/calculator)

  - [Solving algorithms](https://agathasta.github.io/projects-javascript/exercises-JS)

After dipping a toe with JS, in fall I went back-end. Ruby is being a different dimension, I'm quite struggling with the abstraction. I notice I'm developing a quite interesting stubborn streak. The web is being again an incredible help. StackOverflow and Jesus Castello's [RubyGuides](https://www.rubyguides.com/) jump to my mind, but there is a ton of others. Again, the folks at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and all the other Vikings around are utterly amazing!

- RUBY (October / November / December 2020)

  - [Tower of Hanoi](https://github.com/Agathasta/tower_of_hanoi)
  - [Tic-Tac_Toe](https://github.com/Agathasta/tic-tac-toe)
  - [Mastermind](https://github.com/Agathasta/mastermind)
  - [Dictionary](https://github.com/Agathasta/dictionary)
  - [Hangman](https://github.com/Agathasta/hangman)

Besides that, I am following the Ruby Track at [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/Agathasta) and doing daily algorithms at [Edabit](https://edabit.com/user/HfKYDK7gugtCaupsL)  

My next project was Harvard's [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) course, which I loved.  It turned out that without the knowledge I had acquired over the last few months, I wouldn't have had a chance at it.  
Finishing the part on C was a highlight (phew), and then I had to give Python a chance. It's definitely not been love at first sight: I do miss Ruby... But SQL was intuitive, and Django gave me finally the connection between front and back end.  
So I kept going,on one hand doing introductory courses to get a grip on basic computer concepts, on the other with Harvard's [CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50W+Web/home)... None my favoutite language, but that's how much I enjoy these courses.  

I have reached the end of CS50 Web Programming. I haven't submitted my final project yet, and I won't right now. I am again feeling overwhelmed, and I have the feeling I have to search absolutely every tiny step I want to make, which is being kind of frustrating. The  turning point has been, once again, Exercism. I started the Python track only to realize I have no clue about the language, and when I found myself googling how to iterate over a list of tuples I decided this had to change. So I am giving a go to Andrei Neagoie's [Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/) a chance. The idea is to spend some time with Python, then with Django, then with React?
